# 🧊 Ice Pi  
**A mobile GNU/Linux network offense & defense platform**

Ice Pi is a **GNU GPL–licensed**, mobile-controlled **Kali Linux–powered network security device**.  
It is designed for people who **break networks to understand them** — and for those who want to **carry a trusted network with them everywhere**.

Ice Pi turns a single portable device into:
- A full red-team / penetration-testing platform  
- A hardened personal network gateway for hostile environments  

No cloud. No lock-in. No black boxes.

## ⚠️ Legal & Ethical Use

Ice Pi is intended for:
- Authorized penetration testing
- Security research and education
- Network hardening and privacy protection
- Personal device security on untrusted networks

You are responsible for how you use it.  
Do not target networks or devices without explicit permission.

## 🔴 Offensive Security (OffSec)

Ice Pi is **not** a toy device or a limited attack gadget.  
It runs **full Kali Linux**.

**Offensive capabilities**
- USB HID emulation (keyboard / mouse)
- Rubber Ducky–style payload execution
- USB mass storage emulation
- Rogue access points and Wi-Fi spoofing
- Network traffic interception and takeover
- Wi-Fi jamming*  
- Payload-driven automation
- Mobile-controlled red-team operations

If a tool runs on Kali, it runs on Ice Pi.

## 🛡️ Network Safety & Privacy

Ice Pi is also a **portable network firewall**.

It allows you to:
- Route all connected device traffic through:
  - Secure VPN
  - Tor
- Spawn isolated, hardened Wi-Fi networks
- Act as a trusted gateway on public Wi-Fi
- Shield laptops and phones from hostile networks
- Block ads, trackers, and malicious domains at the network level
- Inspect and control traffic before it reaches your devices

You don’t connect to networks.  
You **bring your own**.

## 🔄 One Device, Two Mindsets

Ice Pi is built on the idea that **offense and defense are the same discipline**.

- Simulate hostile networks  
- Defend against hostile networks  
- Test assumptions  
- Control your traffic  

Everything is local. Everything is auditable.
